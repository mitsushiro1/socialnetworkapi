## Description

I was motivated to create this project to help understand mongoDB better and how it would correlate with each other.
I built this project as a demonstration of my knowledge of the mongodb database
It helps me not rely on mysql and use a different database that is not a table
I learnt how to use mongodb, how it relates.

## Installation

clone the code through github, run npm i.

## Usage

after cloning and running npm i, run npm start. You can check the API routes through the video.
